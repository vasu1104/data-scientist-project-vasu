# 🛍️ Retail Sales Forecasting & Insights – Machine Learning Project

This project is a retail sales prediction system developed as part of a Data Science internship. It involves full-cycle machine learning implementation: from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model training, evaluation, and deployment using a Flask API. The model helps businesses forecast future sales and gain insights into product performance trends.
